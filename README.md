# DIY Automated Powder Throw

Designed to be as basic and portable as possible. This automated powder throw is divided into two
main components. The UI and the controls logic. The UI component can run on anything that will
support QT. The controls logic is designed to be micro-agnostic however, implmentation details of
the esp-32 may slip in.


# UI Component
For now, this is the only part of the project that exists. So the build is pretty easy. 
## Build Steps
```
cmake -B build/
cmake --build build/
```
